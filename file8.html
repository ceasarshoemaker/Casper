[file_8: Dearest Casper - my crush, my best friend, my partner, and the love of my life: 
<br>Thank you. Thank you for everything you’ve done for me over the last 6 months (I think that’s how long it’s been?) You’ve helped me realize who i really am, you’ve taught me how to love and be loved, and you’ve made my life so much more beautiful than it was before. I genuinely did not know happiness like i feel with you was real. I thought it was something people only found in storybooks and movies, but Casper it IS real and you make me feel it every single day. You always support me and help me when I’m having a bad day or overthinking or spiraling, and it means the literal world to me. Whenever i get sad or done or upset at all your so amazing because you somehow know exactly the right thing to say and you always make me feel so much better. Even when your sick or upset yourself you always make sure I’m ok too, and knowing that you’ve got my back is one of my favorite feelings in the whole world. Literally as soon as i tell you something wrong i feel better as soon as i see your first text. Your literally magic Casper🤭 and every second i get to spend with you feels magical. You just feel like HOME . Every time we’re cuddled up in each other’s arms I feel feelings I’ve never felt before - never before has anyone loved me like you do Casper. You make me feel wanted and loved and just plain happy every single time that happens and you make me so unbelievably happy. I still get butterflies every time I catch a glimpse of you in the hallway or library at school, and my heart still leaps whenever I get to talk to you or be near you. I still get a little nervous sometimes too, because I have a MASSIVE crush on you 🤭. You literally make me giddy with happiness, and I always want to make you feel as happy as you make me. And dude every time we make eye contact it’s like the outside world stops for a second and I just get lost in your perfect eyes. Suddenly it feels like we’re the only two people in the world, and the beautiful intensity of your gaze is something I will never ever get over. I’m imagining it now and my heart just literally melted. And your VOICE Casper oh my god. Of all the songs I’ve ever listened to, your voice is the prettiest one. It’s the only sound I could listen to forever (and I would really really love to), and all that would happen is I would fall even more in love with you. Whenever I hear you talk or sing or laugh my heart melts because Casper your voice is the most perfect, beautiful sound I’ve ever heard and ever will hear. And funny enough, perfectly beautiful describes you pretty perfectly actually. I don’t even know how to describe it dude, you’re just YOU. Your CASPER. You honestly are beyond perfect because in my entire life I have never even in my wildest dreams imagined someone more perfect than you and I never will. Ever. It’s simply impossible, in fact. (Also I’m watching the clock right now for 1111). Every single part of you is the most beautiful thing I’ve ever seen, Casper. And that applies to ALL of you, not just physically (although cmon let’s be real here your literally the most insanely gorgeous perfect elegant cute hot LITERALLY STUNNING jaw-droppingly beautiful person in the entire world and you blow my mind yet again every single time I see you). (CASPER ITS 1111🤭!!!!!)  Not to get super metaphorical but you are the most beautiful soul ever. Just everything about you is so incredible dude.  You’re so COOL Casper. LIKE YOUR SUCH A COOL PERSON OH MY GOD!! Everything you do is so beautiful and colorful, and oh my god I love the jellyfish thing so so much and it makes me insanely happy that my profile pic is still a jellyfish bc I am so honored that i get to be a jellyfish🤭. Like it makes me smile every single time i see my contact. AND THE CODING!! Casper i genuinely admire you so much. Like that’s so so awesome that you can do all the stuff with changing things in games and i know you say it’s simple or straightforward sometimes but like I’m still so impressed and so proud of you for that stuff because i think you’re so insanely cool for being able to do it. And oh my god the fact that you love legos I think that’s just proof right their that we’re meant to be together because that is the most unimaginably perfect thing ever. LIKE. IM NOT SURE WHY IT GETS ME BUT IT DOES. YOU LOVING LEGOS MAKES ME SO HAPPYYY!!  And i meant it when i said you make me feel like a kid again, and to me that’s one of my favorite things about you- your the first person in my life to make me actually feel perfectly safe and kinda come out of my shell a little. You’ve made me open up in so many ways that i didn’t even know i has closed off and it’s one of the best feelings ever. And it’s really funny to me too because my whole life my parents have been kinda joking that I’m gonna have to “find someone special” who doesn’t mind all the plane stuff and train stuff and Lego stuff and music stuff and all that. And you know what Casper? I did find someone special. I found someone so truly special it’s actually unbelievable. I found someone who I love more than anything in this world or any other world, someone who truly feels like home, who just feels so unmistakably RIGHT, someone who I wake up excited to talk to and see and spend time with every single day, and more than anything someone who loves me back just as much as I love them. I found someone who teaches me to be a better person, who helps me improve myself, someone who changes me forever in ways that I could not have predicted or expected, but says that I will be forever grateful for. I found someone who makes me love myself and the person Im becoming more than ever before. I found someone who encourages me when I’m feeling down and celebrates with me when Im feeling good. I found someone who makes me smile every single day, and more than I ever have before. I found someone who makes me absolutely overjoyed whenever we spend literally any time together. I found someone who is happy to make little inside jokes and little things like saying only “their” and 1111 and great minds and enjoys them just like I do. I found someone who lets me be myself, and loves that me, and lets me love that me. I found someone really really really special, Casper. And guess who that person is? 
<br>It’s you, Casper. 
<br>Of course it’s you. It’s always been you and it always will be you. You are my special person. You’re also literal Spiderman. Obviously. 🤭 I am so incredibly excited for our future, Casper. We’re gonna have so much fun and do so much amazing stuff together, and oh my god i cant wait because it’s gonna be US!! And oh my god every time we talk about our future house it makes me so insanely happy because I CAN’T WAIT. AT ALL. It makes me so giddy even to think about it🤭. When i say you’re the best thing that’s ever happened to me, i mean it Casper. No one and nothing has ever made me as happy as you do every single day, and nothing ever will. The way you make me feel so perfectly loved and understood is something completely irreplaceable and absolutely priceless to me and you are and always will be the most important person in my life. 
<br>I love you, Casper. 
<br>So so unbelievably much. 
<br>Thank you so so much for always being by my side, and being the best partner i could possibly imagine or ask for 🤭. 
<br>Also HAPPY THREE MONTHS DUDE OH MY GOD!!!! WE’RE SO AMAZING DUDE I CAN’T!! LIKE YOU HAVE CHANGED MY LIFE CASPER AND ITS BEEN THE BEST THING EVER!!
Ok I am so tired and i gotta wake up early to hike tomorrow, but i just wanted to write you this to hopefully help show how much you mean to me Casper. You are my everything, always and forever <333
<br>Love, 
<br>Cedar <333 🪼]
